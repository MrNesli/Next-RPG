## Contribution

Contributions of any type are highly welcomed! You can contribute to _code related issues_, _project testing_, _documentation filling_, _proposing suggestions_, _bug tracking_, or just things you would like to have in a text-based **RPG game** which we will give our best shot at bringing them into reality!

If you found the project interesting, and you chose the field you want to contribute to, just write a message to any open issues or on the discord server to get started.
